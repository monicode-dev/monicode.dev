            <p>
                Welcome to my first blog post to this website of mine. I will be building on the information present in the
                <a href="/">home page</a>, so I suggest you read it. Think of it this way, if my home page is the intro,
                this is the full documentary to know everything you need to about me.
            </p>
            <h2>Being Queer</h2>
            <p>
                I feel placing myself into a box as if I perfectly fit into it is lying. So I don't use labels quite as
                "labels", more like descriptors (but that's a discussion for another post).
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I would describe myself as a transgender individual who uses she/they pronouns. As for my
                sexual and romantic attraction, I don't really mind gender, sex or amount of partners. Whether I have a
                preference or not and what it is depends on when you ask.
            </p>
            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently going into my last year of high school, yippee! Over the last 3 years, I've taken
                every computer related class I could get. In fact, I have taken almost every class the school district has
                to offer and I could get a certificate of proficiency if I pass the final class in the series this year.
                Other than that class, I only need to finish off my English class credit to graduate. With all the spare
                class slots I have, I plan to be a teacher assistant for the only computer science teacher in the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I want to go to the nearby university and get a degree in computer science. I will
                probably just get my bachelor's degree, but if things work in my favor, I might even pursue my master's.
            </p>
            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The summer before 7th grade (about 5 years ago), I asked myself and the internet "how do you make a Discord
                bot?". After some searching, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeLyon">CodeLyon's Channel</a> and
                was introduced to programming, more specifically NodeJS. At the time, I was DEEP into <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell">tutorial hell</a>, but over time
                I learned to experiment, not just copy & paste code from videos. I stuck with NodeJS till my 10th grade
                year, when I took Intro to Computer Science and Game Development where I did some light web development and
                played some with Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't till last year (11th grade) that I started taking programming seriously and considered it as a
                career option. This is when I took Advanced Computer Programming, and it was boring as hell. The series of
                computer science courses offered at my high school are pretty copy and paste, and it shows. Anyhow, I
                was taught Python formally in this class and got a chance to tamper with Java for my final project (my
                teacher saw potential and gave me a harder final). This year, I will be taking a class going over <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/index.php">DSA</a> in C++. Then, with that under my belt, I want to
                try and learn Rust and all the low level programming philosophies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I forgot web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those skills are mostly self taught other than some good design and industry practices from my Intro to Web
                Development class.
            </p>
            <h2>Last Words</h2>
            <p>
                I hope you found at least some part of this post interesting. As for my next post, I don't have a good topic
                yet, other than my monthly post (scheduled for early September). If you want to submit a topic idea, DM me
                on Discord at <code>monicode.dev</code> or email me at <code><a href="mailto:monika@monicode.dev">monika@monicode.dev</a></code>. Have a good
                one, and thanks for reading!

        <title>September's Monthly Post</title>
        <summary>My monthly post for September</summary>
        <link href="https://monicode.dev/blogs/sep-post" />
        <updated>2025-09-06T13:00:00Z</updated>

                <article>
                    <p>Welcome to my monthly post for September! This is my status update post where I talk about where I&#39;ve
                        been, what I&#39;ve done, and/or what I&#39;ve learned in the last month. So lets get into it with my
                        <strong>biggest</strong> news...
                    </p>
                    <h2 id="getting-my-license-">Getting my license!</h2>
                    <p>I <strong>officially</strong> got my license and my car registered! About two weeks ago I got my plates for
                        my car and about a week ago I got the actual card for my license. <em>However</em>, there is still some work
                        to be done. You see, I got an old <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saturn_L-Series">2001 Saturn L200
                        </a> <sup>(a.k.a. LS1)</sup> that has driven over 200,000 miles over it&#39;s life time. Owning that old
                        and that used of a car requires some maintenance. As you can see below, it&#39;s not the best cosmetically:
                        sun damaged paint, no hood emblem (the new one just came in the mail), cracked windshield, no hub caps, etc.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <img src="/images/saturn.jpg" alt="A red, sun damaged 2001 Saturn L200">
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Mechanically, it has a 4-cylinder 2.2 L engine (translation: small engine and no get-up-and-go). It
                        currently has no AC and some regular maintenance here and there is a little over due. However, I&#39;m not
                        going in completely blind. My mother used to work on her old &#39;99 Jeep and my father still maintains his
                        car. Adding on, I&#39;m also taking my school&#39;s Intro to Automotive class next semester. With all that
                        said, I&#39;d say I did really good with my first car. I&#39;m hoping to learn a lot from owning an older
                        car that requires a little bit of love and care. On the topic of learning...</p>
                    <h2 id="school-has-started-for-me">School has started for me</h2>
                    <p>Unfortunately, I now have to go to school (hence why this post is being posted later than I wanted). Luckily,
                        I don&#39;t have much this first semester. My school operates on an A/B day schedule. My A days are pretty
                        boring, only teacher assistant work and study hall. But my B days are where all the fun is. I have a class
                        on Network Fundamentals and Computer Systems. Unfortunately, I don&#39;t get to do <a
                            href="https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/index.php">DSA</a> till next semester :(</p>
                    <h2 id="misc">Misc</h2>
                    <p>As for miscellaneous news, I am trying Arch Linux again, this time on my Thinkpad T495. I got inspired by my
                        friend, <a href="https://www.ztchary.net/">ztchary</a>, to work on a rice setup. Once I&#39;ve made some
                        good progress or I finish it, there may be an update post on it if I don&#39;t decide to wait till the next
                        monthly post.
                        Lastly, I got promoted at my job to be shift lead! It also comes with a nice $2.35 pay bump, but also, more
                        responsibilities (more explanation to the lateness of this post).</p>
                    <h2 id="last-words">Last Words</h2>
                    <p>Thanks for reading to the end! Like always, I hope you found some of this interesting. As said before, I plan
                        on making an update post to the Arch Linux rice. If I don&#39;t before the beginning of October, then
                        I&#39;ll see you for the next monthly post! I love y&#39;all and have a good one! </p>
