            <p>
                Welcome to my first blog post to this website of mine. I will be building on the information present in the
                <a href="/">home page</a>, so I suggest you read it. Think of it this way, if my home page is the intro,
                this is the full documentary to know everything you need to know about me.
            </p>
            <h2>Being Queer</h2>
            <p>
                I feel placing myself into a box as if I perfectly fit into it is lying. So I don't use labels quite as
                "labels", more like descriptors (but that's a discussion for another post).
            </p>
            <p>
                With that said, I would describe myself as a transgender individual who uses she/they pronouns. As for my
                sexual and romantic attraction, I don't really mind gender, sex or amount of partners. If I have a
                preference and what it is depends on when you ask.
            </p>
            <h2>Schooling</h2>
            <p>
                I am currently going into my senior/last year of high school, yippee! Over the last 3 years, I've taken
                every computer related class I could get. In fact, I have taken almost every class the school district has
                to offer and I could get a certificate of proficiency if I pass the final class in the series this year.
                Other than that class, I only need to finish off my English class credit to graduate. With all the spare
                class slots I have, I plan to be a teacher assistant for the only computer science teacher in the school.
            </p>
            <p>
                After high school, I want to go to the nearby university and get a degree in computer science. I will
                probably just get my bachelor's degree, but if things work in my favor, I might even pursue my master's.
            </p>
            <h2>Programming Experience</h2>
            <p>
                The summer before 7th grade (about 5 years ago), I asked myself and the internet "how do you make a Discord
                bot?". After some searching, I found <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CodeLyon">CodeLyon's Channel</a> and
                was introduced to programming, more specifically NodeJS. At the time, I was DEEP into <a
                    href="https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Tutorial%20Hell">tutorial hell</a>, but over time
                I learned to experiment, not just copy & paste code from videos. I stuck with NodeJS till my 10th grade
                year, when I took Intro to Computer Science and Game Development where I did some light web development and
                played some with Unity.
            </p>
            <p>
                It wasn't till last year (11th grade) that I started taking programming seriously and considered it as a
                career option. This is when I took Advanced Computer Programming, and it was boring as hell. The series of
                computer science courses offered at my high school are pretty copy and paste, and it shows here. Anyhow, I
                was taught Python formally in this class and got a chance to tamper with Java for my final project (my
                teacher saw potential and gave me a harder final). This year, I will be taking a class going over <a
                    href="https://www.w3schools.com/dsa/index.php">DSA</a> in C++. Then, with that under my belt, I want to
                try and learn Rust and all the low level programming philosophies.
            </p>
            <p>
                I forgot web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                Those skills are mostly self taught other than some good design and industry practices from my Intro to Web
                Development class.
            </p>
            <h2>Last Words</h2>
            <p>
                I hope you found at least some part of this post interesting. As for my next post, I don't have a good topic
                yet, other than my monthly post (scheduled for early September). If you want to submit a topic idea, DM me
                on Discord at <code>monicode.dev</code> or email me at <code><a href="mailto:monika@monicode.dev">monika@monicode.dev</a></code>. Have a good
                one, and thanks for reading!
